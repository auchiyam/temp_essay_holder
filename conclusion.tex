\section{Conclusion}

Over the course of this internship program, I learned valuable skills.  I have managed and developed a large program all by myself, and used many skills I've learned over the four years of computer science courses.  Moving forward, I would like to continue developing this code until I remove as much bug as possible.  I would also like to apply what I have learned in this internship, both as a student and as a programmer, in the future, and become a well established programmer.
